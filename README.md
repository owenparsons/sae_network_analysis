# Feature Interactions in Language Models

This repository contains code used for the research project found here: [Exploring Feature Co-Occurrence Networks with SAEs](https://owenparsons.github.io/saes/).

This was done as a final project for the [BlueDot AI Alignment course](https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/)

## Project Description

The project focused on investigating how we can gain a broader picture of feature interactions in language models by combining current interpretability techniques with network analysis.

I tried to answer three key questions:

1. Can we uncover structure in SAE features by examining co-occurrence patterns, specifically through correlations between feature attribution values?
2. How can we leverage feature steering techniques to gain insights into the dependencies between co-occurring features, or alternatively, to understand how they might contribute independently in similar ways?
3. To what extent can we apply network analysis approaches to assess feature importance and illuminate the relationships between features?

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following libraries:
- [SAE Lens](https://github.com/yourusername/sae-lens)
- [Transformer Lens](https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-lens)

## Future Updates

More functionality will be added shortly, and a demo notebook will also be incorporated to showcase the capabilities of this research.
